======================
Advanced Configuration
======================

Here are the personal configurations that you can modify within Sphinx-Gallery.

.. _multiple_galleries_config:

Manage Multiple galleries
=========================

Sphinx-Gallery only supports up to sub-folder level in its gallery directories.
This might be a limitation for you. Or you might want to have separate
galleries for different purposes, an examples gallery and a tutorials gallery.
For this you use in your Sphinx ``conf.py`` file a list of directories in
the sphinx configuration dictionary:

.. code-block:: python

    sphinx_gallery_conf = {
        'examples_dirs'   : ['../examples', '../tutorials'],
        'gallery_dirs'    : ['auto_examples', 'tutorials'],
    }

Keep in mind that both lists have to be of the same length.

.. _build_pattern:

Building examples matching a pattern
====================================

By default, Sphinx-Gallery execute only examples beginning with ``plot``. However,
if this naming convention does not suit your project, you can modify this pattern
in your Sphinx ``conf.py``. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    sphinx_gallery_conf = {
        'filename_pattern'  : '/plot_compute_'
    }

will build all examples starting with ``plot_compute_``. The key ``filename_pattern`` accepts
`regular expressions`_ which will be matched with the full path of the example. This is the reason
the leading ``'/'`` is required. Users are advised to use ``os.sep`` instead of ``'/'`` if
they want to be agnostic to the operating system.

This option is also useful if you want to build only a subset of the examples. For example, you may
want to build only one example so that you can link it in the documentation. In that case,
you would do:

.. code-block:: python

    sphinx_gallery_conf = {
        'filename_pattern' : 'plot_awesome_example.py'
    }

Here, one should escape the dot ``'\.'`` as otherwise python `regular expressions`_ matches any character. Nevertheless, as
one is targetting a specific file, it is most certainly going to match the dot in the filename.

Similarly, to build only examples in a specific directory, you can do:

.. code-blocK:: python

    sphinx_gallery_conf = {
        'filename_pattern' : '/directory/plot_'
    }

Alternatively, you can skip some examples. For example, to skip building examples
starting with ``plot_long_examples_``, you would do:

.. code-block:: python

    sphinx_gallery_conf = {
        'filename_pattern' : '/plot_(?!long_examples)'
    }

As the patterns are parsed as `regular expressions`_, users are advised to consult the
`regular expressions`_ module for more details.

.. _link_to_documentation:

Linking to documentation
========================

Sphinx-Gallery enables you to add hyperlinks in your example scripts so that
you can link the used functions to their matching online documentation. As such
code snippets within the gallery appear like this

.. raw:: html

    <div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>
    <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.9.1/reference/generated/numpy.sin.html#numpy.sin"><span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sin</span></a><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
    </pre></div>
    </div>

Have a look at this in full action
in our example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_gallery_version.py`.

To make this work in your documentation you need to include to the configuration
dictionary within your Sphinx ``conf.py`` file :

.. code-block:: python

    sphinx_gallery_conf = {
        'reference_url':  {
                 # The module you locally document uses a None
                'sphinx_gallery': None,

                # External python modules use their documentation websites
                'matplotlib': 'http://matplotlib.org',
                'numpy': 'http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.9.1'}
        }


.. _references_to_examples:

Establishing local references to examples
=========================================

Sphinx-Gallery also enables you, when documenting your modules, to
reference to the examples that use that particular class or
function. For example if we are documenting the numpy.linspace
function its possible to embed a small gallery of examples using it
like this:

.. include:: modules/generated/numpy.linspace.examples
.. raw:: html

        <div style='clear:both'></div>



For such behavior to be available you have to extend in your
Sphinx-Gallery configuration directory with:

.. code-block:: python

    sphinx_gallery_conf = {
        # path to store the module using example template
        'mod_example_dir'     : 'modules/generated',

        # Your documented modules. In this case sphinx_gallery and numpy
        # in a tuple of strings.
        'doc_module'          : ('sphinx_gallery', 'numpy')}

The path you specify in ``mod_example_dir`` will get populated with
ReStructuredText files describing the examples thumbnails with links
to them but only for the specific module. Keep in mind is relative to
the `conf.py` file.


Then within your sphinx documentation files you
include these lines to include these links::

    .. include:: modules/generated/numpy.linspace.examples
    .. raw:: html

        <div style='clear:both'></div>

Auto documenting your API with links to examples
------------------------------------------------

The previous feature can be automated for all your modules combining
it with the standard sphinx extensions `autodoc
<http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/autodoc.html>`_ and `autosummary
<http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/autosummary.html>`_. First enable it in your
``conf.py`` extensions list.

.. code-block:: python

    import sphinx_gallery
    extensions = [
        ...
        'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
	'sphinx.ext.autosummary',
        ]

    # generate autosummary even if no references
    autosummary_generate = True

To document all your modules and their functions you can put to your
autosummary template for modules. For example for this documentation
we use:

.. literalinclude:: _templates/module.rst

Then when documenting your API you call autosummary like:

.. literalinclude:: reference.rst


Using a custom default thumbnail image
======================================

In case you want to use your own image for the thumbnail of examples that do
not generate any plot, you can specify it by editing your Sphinx ``conf.py``
file. You need to add to the configuration dictionary a key called
`default_thumb_file`. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    sphinx_gallery_conf = {
        'default_thumb_file'     : 'path/to/thumb/file.png'}}


Choosing the thumbnail image from multiple figures
==================================================

For examples that generate multiple figures, the default behavior will use
the first figure created in each as the thumbnail image displayed in the
gallery. To change the thumbnail image to a figure generated later in
an example script, add a comment to the example script to specify the
number of the figure you would like to use as the thumbnail. For example,
to use the 2nd figure created as the thumbnail:

.. code-block:: python

    # sphinx_gallery_thumbnail_number = 2

The default behavior is ``sphinx_gallery_thumbnail_number = 1``. See
:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_choose_thumbnail.py` for an example
of this functionality.

Embedding Sphinx-Gallery inside your documentation script extensions
====================================================================

If you want to embed Sphinx-Gallery in your project instead of putting
it as a dependency you can call our embedding script inside your
Sphinx extensions folder::

  $ copy_sphinxgallery.sh

This will download directly from PyPI our latest released code and
save it to the current folder. This is a striped version of the
Sphinx-Gallery module to incorporate in your project. You should also
add it to your version control system.

Build the Gallery without executing the examples
================================================

Sphinx-Gallery can parse all your examples and build the gallery
without executing any of the scripts. This is just for speed
visualization processes of the gallery and the size it takes your
website to display, or any use you can imagine for it. To achieve this you
need to pass the no plot option in the build process by modifying
your ``Makefile`` with::

    html-noplot:
        $(SPHINXBUILD) -D plot_gallery=0 -b html $(ALLSPHINXOPTS) $(BUILDDIR)/html
        @echo
        @echo "Build finished. The HTML pages are in $(BUILDDIR)/html."

Remember that for ``Makefile`` white space is significant and the indentation are tabs
and not spaces

Dealing with failing Gallery example scripts
============================================

As your project evolves some of your example scripts might stop
executing properly. Sphinx-Gallery assist you in the discovery process
of those bugged examples. The default behavior is to replace the
thumbnail of those examples in the gallery with the broken
thumbnail. That allows you to find with a quick glance of the gallery
which examples failed. Broken examples remain accessible in the html
view of the gallery and the traceback message is written for the
failing code block. Refer to example
:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_raise.py` to view the default
behavior.

An extra functionality of Sphinx-Gallery is the early fail option. In
this mode the gallery build process breaks as soon as an exception
occurs in the execution of the examples scripts. To activate this
behavior you need to pass a flag at the build process. It can be done
by including in your ``Makefile``::

    html_abort_on_example_error:
	$(SPHINXBUILD) -D abort_on_example_error=1 -b html $(ALLSPHINXOPTS) $(BUILDDIR)/html
	@echo
	@echo "Build finished. The HTML pages are in $(BUILDDIR)/html."

Remember that for ``Makefile`` white space is significant and the indentation are tabs
and not spaces.

Alternatively, you can also instead add the ``abort_on_example_error`` option to
the ``sphinx_gallery_conf`` inside your ``conf.py`` configuration file.
