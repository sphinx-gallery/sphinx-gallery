Features of Sphinx-Gallery
==========================

* :ref:`create_simple_gallery` by automatically running Python files,
  capturing outputs + figures, and rendering
  them into rST files ready for Sphinx when you build the documentation.
  Learn how to :ref:`set_up_your_project`
* :ref:`embedding_rst`, allowing you to interweave narrative-like content
  with code that generates plots in your documentation. Sphinx-Gallery also
  automatically generates a Jupyter Notebook for each your example page.
* :ref:`references_to_examples`. Sphinx-Gallery can generate mini-galleries
  listing all examples that use a particular function/method/etc.
* :ref:`link_to_documentation`. Sphinx-Gallery can automatically add links to
  API documentation for functions/methods/classes that are used in your
  examples (for any Python module that uses intersphinx).
* :ref:`multiple_galleries_config` to create and embed galleries for several
  folders of examples.
