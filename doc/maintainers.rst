How to make a release
=====================

* Update the change log

  Use `github_changelog_generator
  <https://github.com/skywinder/github-changelog-generator#installation>`_ to
  gather all merged pull requests and closed issues during the development
  cycle. We do this because our failing discipline of writing in the
  CHANGES.rst all relevant changes, this helps our memory.

  .. code-block:: bash

     github_changelog_generator sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery

  Read the changes in the generated CHANGELOG.md and propagate the relevant to
  CHANGES.rst

* Update version

  Update the version in ``sphinx_gallery/__init__.py``.

* Build the docs cleanly

  Make sure to clean all and have a clean build. Double-check visually that
  everything looks right.

* Push to your own master branch and check CI is happy
* Draft release

  copy and edit to github markdown all changes from CHANGELOG.md.

* Build a source distribution

  .. code-block:: bash

     python setup.py sdist

* Test upload to PyPI

  .. code-block:: bash

     twine upload --repository test dist/sphinx-gallery-<version>.tar.gz

* Upload to PyPI


  .. code-block:: bash

     twine upload dist/sphinx-gallery-<version>.tar.gz
