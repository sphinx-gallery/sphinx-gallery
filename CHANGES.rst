v0.4.0
------

Developer changes
'''''''''''''''''
- Added a private API contract for external scrapers to have string-based
  support, see:

    https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/494

- Standard error is now caught and displayed alongside standard output.
- Some sphinx markup is now removed from image thumbnail tooltips.

Incompatible changes
''''''''''''''''''''
- v0.4.0 will be the last release to support Python <= 3.4.
- Moving forward, we will support only the latest two stable Sphinx releases
  at the time of each sphinx-gallery release.

v0.3.1
------

Bugfix release: add missing file that prevented "pip installing" the
package.

**Fixed bugs:**

- Version 0.3.0 release is broken on pypi
  `#459 <https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/issues/459>`__

v0.3.0
------

Incompatible changes
''''''''''''''''''''

* the output figure numbering is always 1, 2, ..., ``number_of_figures``
  whereas in 0.2.0 it would follow the matplotlib figure numbers. If you
  include explicitly some figures generated by sphinx-gallery with the ``..
  figure`` directive in your ``.rst`` documentation you may need to adjust
  their paths if your example uses non-default matplotlib figure numbers (e.g.
  if you use ``plt.figure(0)``). See `#464
  <https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/issues/464>` for more
  details.

Developer changes
'''''''''''''''''

* Dropped support for Sphinx <= 1.4.
* Refactor for independent rst file construction. Function
  ``sphinx_gallery.gen_rst.generate_file_rst`` does not anymore compose the
  rst file while it is executing each block of the source code. Currently
  executing the example script ``execute_script`` is an independent
  function and returns structured in a list the rst representation of the
  output of each source block. ``generate_file_rst`` calls for execution of
  the script when needed, then from the rst output it composes an rst
  document which includes the prose, code & output of the example which is
  the directly saved to file including the annotations of binder badges,
  download buttons and timing statistics.
* Binder link config changes. The configuration value for the BinderHub has
  been changed from ``url`` to ``binderhub_url`` in order to make it more
  explicit. The old configuration key (``url``) will be deprecated in
  version v0.4.0)
* Support for generating JUnit XML summary files via the ``'junit'``
  configuration value, which can be useful for building on CI services such as
  CircleCI. See the related `CircleCI doc <https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/collect-test-data/#metadata-collection-in-custom-test-steps>`__
  and `blog post <https://circleci.com/blog/how-to-output-junit-tests-through-circleci-2-0-for-expanded-insights/>`__.

Incompatible Changes
''''''''''''''''''''

  variable was set. See `#349
  <https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/349>`_ for more
  details.
* ``Backreferences_dir`` is now mandatory `#307 <https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/307>`_

Developer changes

v0.1.13
-------

New features
''''''''''''

* Added ``min_reported_time`` configurable.  For examples that run faster than
  that threshold (in seconds), the execution time is not reported.
* Add thumbnail_size option `#283 <https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/283>`_
* Use intersphinx for all function reference resolution `#296 <https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/296>`_

  of ``True``, as it avoids a warning about unicode when controlling this value via the command line
  switches of ``sphinx-build``
