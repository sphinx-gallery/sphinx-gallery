v0.1.13
-------

New features
''''''''''''

* Added ``min_reported_time`` configurable.  For examples that run faster than
  that threshold (in seconds), the execution time is not reported.
* Add thumbnail_size option `#283 <https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/283>`_
* Use intersphinx for all function reference resolution `#296 <https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/296>`_
* Sphinx only directive for downloads `#298 <https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/298>`_
* Allow sorting subsection files `#281 <https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/281>`_
* We recommend using a string for ``plot_gallery`` rather than Python booleans, e.g. ``'True'`` instead
  of ``True``, as it avoids a warning about unicode when controlling this value via the command line
  switches of ``sphinx-build``

  notebooks for each gallery

  notebook text blocks

  inline math and multi-line equations

v0.1.3
------

New features
''''''''''''
* Summary of failing examples with traceback at the end of the sphinx
  build. By default the build exits with a 1 exit code if an example
  has failed. A list of examples that are expected to fail can be
  defined in `conf.py` and exit the build with 0
  exit code. Alternatively it is possible to exit the build as soon as
  one example has failed.
* Print aggregated and sorted list of computation times of all examples
  in the console during the build.
* For examples that create multiple figures, set the thumbnail image.
* The ``plot_gallery`` and ``abort_on_example_error`` options can now
