* Download buttons have a nicer look across all themes offered by
  Sphinx

Developer changes
'''''''''''''''''
* Support on the fly theme change for local builds of the
  Sphinx-Gallery docs. Passing to the make target the variable `theme`

  plus read the docs online theme under the value `rtd` as shown in this
  usage example.::

    $ make html theme=rtd

------

New features
''''''''''''

* Download buttons at the end of the gallery to download all python
  scripts or Jupyter notebooks together in a zip file. New config
  variable `download_all_examples` to toggle this effect. Activated by
  default
* Downloadable zip file with all examples as Python scripts and
  notebooks for each gallery
* Improved conversion of rst directives to markdown for the Jupyter
  notebook text blocks

Bug Fixes
'''''''''
* When seaborn is imported in a example the plot style preferences are
  transferred to plots executed afterwards. The CI is set up such that
  users can follow how to get the compatible versions of
  mayavi-pandas-seaborn and nomkl in a conda environment to have all
  the features available.
* Fix math conversion from example rst to Jupyter notebook text for
  inline math and multi-line equations

v0.1.3
------

New features
''''''''''''
* Summary of failing examples with traceback at the end of the sphinx
  build. By default the build exits with a 1 exit code if an example
  has failed. A list of examples that are expected to fail can be
  defined in `conf.py` and exit the build with 0
  exit code. Alternatively it is possible to exit the build as soon as
  one example has failed.
* Print aggregated and sorted list of computation times of all examples
  in the console during the build.
* For examples that create multiple figures, set the thumbnail image.
* The ``plot_gallery`` and ``abort_on_example_error`` options can now
  be specified in ``sphinx_gallery_conf``. The build option (``-D``
  flag passed to ``sphinx-build``) takes precedence over the
  ``sphinx_gallery_conf`` option.
